## Overview
This repository contains research code and experimental implementations focused on the intersection of **Stochastic Processes**, **Optimal Transport** and **Data Analysis**.

## Current Research Areas

### 1. Optimal Transport Analysis of Stochastic Processes
* **Objective:** Applying Wasserstein Barycenter to separate iid innovation noise from functional dependence from the past for time-series generative models.
* **Implementation:** Different saddle point update algorithms (first order and second order) with both forward differentiation and backpropagation through time.
* **Tools:** Python (NumPy, PyTorch), MATLAB.
* **Status:** Active development.

### 2. Mathematical Foundations
* Analysis of algorithms relies on:
    * Properties of stochastic processes (State Space Models, NGSSM, GARCH and stochastic volatility).
    * Maxmin/Minmax gaps and Convex Duality.
